#Analysis of Lawson Adventure Park's Twitter (plus some Instagram data analysis and a dashboard)

The order of the Jupyter notebooks is as follows:

  1) Gathering Lawson Adventure Park's Tweets
  2) Gathering Lawson's Followers
  3) Twitter Affinity Analysis - Lawson Adventure Park
 
The finalrecords.csv shows the results of the affinity analysis. 

Each R analysis file is paired with a csv file. Most of the analysis in each file is the same. The results from these analyses was used to create the Lawson Adventure Park dashboard in Excel. (all the plots are created in ggplot in R, but I redid them in Excel)
