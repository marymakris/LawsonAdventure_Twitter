#Analysis of Lawson Adventure Park's Twitter (plus some Instagram data analysis and a dashboard)

The order of the Jupyter notebooks is as follows:

  1) Gathering Lawson Adventure Park's Tweets
  2) Gathering Lawson's Followers
  3) Twitter Affinity Analysis - Lawson Adventure Park
 
The affinity_scores.csv shows the results of the affinity analysis. 

In addition, data scraped from Instagram was analyzed to determine key metrics for posts with the hashtag discgolf, posts with Denver, CO as the location tag, and Lawson's posts. Each R analysis file is paired with a csv file, and most of the analysis in each file is the same. The results from these analyses were used to create the Lawson Adventure Park dashboard in Excel. (all the plots are created in ggplot in R, but I redid them in Excel) 

Note: The majority of the R code used for analysis was from Jess Diehl's work over the summer with TOMIS on similar data files.
